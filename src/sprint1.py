1. Problem Definition:
Clearly define the problem that the simulation aims to address. Identify the objectives, constraints, and key performance 
indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of the simulation.

2. Modeling:
Develop a mathematical or computational model that represents the real-world system being simulated. Define the entities,
variables, and relationships within the system. Choose an appropriate simulation paradigm (e.g., discrete-event simulation,
                                                                                        continuous simulation).
3. Input Data Generation:
Collect or generate the input data required for the simulation. This may include historical data, statistical distributions,
or other parameters that influence the behavior of the system.

4. Initialization:
Set the initial conditions of the simulation, including the starting values of variables, states of entities, and any other
relevant parameters.
    
5. Time Management:
Define the simulation time frame and time increments. Manage the simulation clock and progress through time steps or events.

6. State Update:
Update the state of the system based on the events or continuous processes. This involves calculating changes in variables,
entity states, or other relevant parameters.

7. Data Logging:
Log relevant simulation data at specified intervals or when significant events occur. This data is crucial for analysis,
validation, and performance evaluation.

8. Condition Checking:
Check conditions or constraints to determine if specific actions need to be taken. This could involve decision-making based on
predefined rules or criteria.

9. Output Generation:
Generate output data that reflects the state of the system at different points in time. This output may include performance
metrics, visualizations, or reports.

10. Analysis and Validation:
Analyze the simulation results to assess the system's behavior, evaluate performance metrics, and validate the simulation
against real-world data or expectations.

11.Optimization (if applicable):
If the simulation aims to optimize certain parameters, implement optimization algorithms or strategies to improve system
performance based on the simulation results.

12. Scenario Exploration (if applicable):
Explore different scenarios by varying input parameters or conditions to understand how the system responds to different
situations.

13. Documentation:
Document the simulation process, including assumptions, limitations, and any adjustments made during the modeling and execution
phases. This documentation is essential for reproducibility and future reference.

14. Conclusion and Reporting:
Draw conclusions from the simulation results and prepare a final report summarizing key findings, insights, and recommendations.
